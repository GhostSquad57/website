This is my website that I'm working on. It's coded in HTML/CSS and I have plans to add some Javascript to make the site more interactive. The site uses [video.js](http://videojs.com/) with the [video.js YouTube plugin](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-youtube) for the video on the homepage - I plan on having a seperate Videos page to showcase my recent videos. But for now, the "videos" section just links to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQZbfMs3ytzjT0hLEvJPvcQ)

The site uses [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for the icons because it's freaking great. The headings use the [Roboto Slab Typeface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) and the text body uses [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

The server is hosted on a Linux machine. The webpages are served using [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
